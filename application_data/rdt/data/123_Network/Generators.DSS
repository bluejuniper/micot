! Generator Definitions

! The following buses just have a voltage target and kvar limits defined.
! The kW value is defined as zero, but this is illegal in the OpenDSS Generator model
! So we just put a small value (1 kW) here and use model 3 to regulate the bus.


! Will will manually define a generator at the vsource in bus 150 because the DCOM API won't let us go there.
